## 1. Introduction

Introduction: Employee Satisfaction Software measures the level of satisfaction employees have with their work and helps to receive feedback in a friendly manner. By using this software, companies can identify areas for improvement and work on strategies to increase employee satisfaction and retention. Furthermore, it allows employees to express their opinions and concerns safely and anonymously, fostering a more open and communicative work environment. This project has been developed using the MERN stack, with MongoDB as the database for its ease of deployment. For the backend, I used Node.js along with the Express.js framework to create the API quickly, and finally, the frontend was developed using React.js for its versatility and ability to separate the application into components. The frontend was created using the Vite bundler for its fast code compilation.

## 2. Requirements

Frontend Dependencies:

"axios": "^1.3.4"
"react": "^18.2.0"
"react-dom": "^18.2.0"
"react-router-dom": "^6.8.2"
"styled": "^1.0.0"
"styled-components": "^5.3.8"

Backend Dependencies:

"cors": "^2.8.5"
"express": "^4.18.2"
"jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.0"
"mongoose": "^7.0.2" 

## 3. Installation

Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js)
- git (https://git-scm.com)
- mongodb (https://www.mongodb.com)

# Frontend

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  - git clone https://github.com/SeroC00l/ESAT
  
2. Navigate to the frontend directory within the project:
  - cd your-project-name/frontend
 
3. Install the dependencies using npm
  - npm install

4. Start the development server.
  - npm run dev
 The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:5173 (or another available port).
